				That was it! She had done it a thousand times by hand, the old way. But this was new. Feeling it click, the pieces sliding into place and moving your whole body forward.<br>
				Her world expanded, the view broadened. The n3t started to unravel into its natural form and reveal itself.<br>
				But this was not the time to take it all in, this was business.<br>
				She had done small jobs before, all low profile work to get by. When the text on her terminal suddenly flashed she was already hooked.<br>
				Getting a free, untracked l0g1n as a perk was just the cherry on top of the cake.<br>
				This job was special. She did not know why but she couldn't refuse. Something was odd, different.
			</p>
			<p>
				Focus!
			</p>
			<p>
				She had to get in, grab the package and drop it of. That was the deal. No diversions. No side effects. Clean and simple.<br>
				The target? Sos큰 Neotech. One of the five large company states. It was not necessarily a high class attack since the size of Sos큰 Neotech made it split, fork and interconnect like a fractal. Some areas being essentially independent it resembled a hydra more than a dragon.<br>
				However, there was at least some kind of central management. One of the few unrestricted AIs still running. AIs can scale with Moore and are inherently polymorphic, humans have to build slow interconnectiong networks and gain overhead until the group becomes to inert to react and form even the most simple decisions.<br>
				Guess who wins the race when it comes to financial and executive decisions for companies the size of a continent.
			</p>
			<p>
				Right now, however, her worries were with high level issues.<br>
				We all invulantarily transmit data moving through us3rsp4ce, more than we think.<br>
				And now she was about to be scanned by a perimeter bot. These things look for a specific string all users transmit over the network by default.<br>
				Usually used to taylor content to the specifics of the users access software, but around here it served a different purpose. Drifting around the 7th circle of security layers of Sos큰 this little script just checked for an identifier, a hash, no credentials or secrets, just something to let him know not to direct another way, make sure you knew that you were probably lost.
				<br>
				<br>
				But she wasn't...
			</p>
<!--
This bot was looking for a Sos큰 User Agent Identifier she had cracked weeks ago, easy sauce, just a simple md5 hash of the first 7 digits of
pi. It was basically common knowledge to the entities moving in these areas but obscurity does create a, albeit virtual, layer of security.
