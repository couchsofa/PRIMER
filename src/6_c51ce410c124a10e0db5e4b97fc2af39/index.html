      She wasn't sure if this had been a honey pot, designed to attract unwanted guests and trap them, but the place she was looking at right now certainly looked like an intranet of one of the big five.<br>
      She began moving through the neon wasteland toward a pulsating skyline.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vastness of the structures floating in this neon desert indicated the shear amount of information that was stored, processed and generated by the R&D department.
      There wasn't much complexity to be found here, but it took a long time to navigate, time for her to think about what she had seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      That the five were run by AIs was a generally accepted fact. Nobody knew for sure because these pieces of code were locked behind layers upon layers of heavy ic3. Breaking that stuff was almost impossible and not just designed to keep flow from reaching in but also engineered to limit the access of the AI core.<br>
      How did the SosÅ« core manage to reach her? And even more scary, why?
    </p>
    <p>
      She had experienced what even high level core engineers tried to avoid: being directly connected to the central AI core.<br>
      It had changed something, she wasn't sure what but she felt exposed, exploited, distanced from her feeling of self.<br>
      Exposed... she had to push on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luckily the operators didn't expect penetration to the intranet and had left most of the network exposed.
