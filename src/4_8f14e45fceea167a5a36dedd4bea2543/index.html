      Relax. Breath. It will all be over soon. She told herself. But why?<br>
      Why couldn't she stop? Just plug out, leave all of this fucked up mess of a job behind and never come back...
    </p>

      It wasn't in her power to stop. On a deeper level she already knew that when she accepted the offer. It had called her, spoke to her, her insticts, the lizard brain.<br>
      It. That word. Not quite the right pronoun. But how do you refer to an entity that is essentially composed of a stream of electrons, ever moving and shifting but representing an autonomous being on a higher level. You couldn't understand the higher layers in terms of the smallest parts and even seeing the code at a given point won't tell you anything about the structures to be generated next.<br>
      But were humans fundamentally that different?
