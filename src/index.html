    This world is different.<br>
    It's constantly moving, always shifting, dynamic. Space is not a concept of this place, it is a concept applied to it.
    A human way of making sense of the structure and failing, ultimately, at the non Euclidian nature of this electronic expanse.
    Some people naturally adapt when confronted with the complexity of the n3t.<br>
    It's a way of thinking, of making sense of the world around you, not accepting an answer but striving to find meaning in the underlying structure of the problem.
    Out there it is hidden, the structure, under a myriad of layers, but here, in this man-machine-made world you can touch it, catch a glimpse and reach in and twist the flow.

    She awoke from a tingling feeling in her spine, not a shiver but defenitely moving down her back. Slowly she stood up and opened her eyes, still feeling a bit dizzy. She had heard about people having much harsher reactions to their first l0g1n, especially on enregistered equiptment.<br>
    Right, her mind lit up, short  term memory came back, frontal lobe started firing again - she had to move fast!<br>
    Eighty three hops (she had counted), thirteen of them encrypted proxys, seven border gateways. Not a trivial trace but finite none the less.
    </p>
    <p>
    Regaining composure she took in the scene. It was neon. A dense forest with traces flowing in wild patterns but never crossing, never touching at steep angles and glowing vividly blue and purple.<br>
    It was the view from the front, you couldn't possibly make sense of it and that scared her tremendously because it meant that she was still in us3rl4nd. She would never be able to move fast enaugh or even reach the places she needed to go from here ... <br>
    she craved the meta, the source, the access!
    </p>
    <p>
    There was one spot that attracted her naturally, a point were the traces accumulated and formed a connection, a terminal accepting input from the us3rl4nd, a f0rm.<br>
    This one was of a family very well known to her, easily exploited to grant you access to another level, and that was all she needed for now.<br>
    Reaching in she began to twist the stream, adjust the flow and after a few practiced moves she felt it, access, the meta, finally moving on.<br>

      Some f0rms are easier than others.
      This one was just a means to get to the next level so there was no need for her to apply her full set of skills or fake credentials. Manufacturing a bo0le4n response would probably be enaugh to let her pass.
