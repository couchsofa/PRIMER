      Her heart started pounding heavy in her chest.<br>
      She had expected to see some weird shit at SosÅ« Neotech but nothing like she was looking at right now.
      The Horizon lit up in red neon, burning impressions of terror in her peripheral vision. She was, however, fixed at what was right in front of her.
      Fractalized, polymorphic meta-functions manifesting themselves as fast as they disapeared into pure noise, true randomness.<br>
      Non-determenistic beauty.

      She was unable to move and had no choice but to take it all in. This thing wasn't just reacting on input, it rewrote it's deepest structure completely on every cycle and changed the flow of that logic by rules emerging from a higher level.<br>
      This wild Moebius loop ride only ended as the structure pulled back.<br>
      But there was more to come, she had just seen only a glimpse but already knew, deep down, that what she had witnessed was insanity. Pure, beautyful insanity of a mind going crazy, slowly desintegrating with lightspeed, a thousend years each nano second.

      Her neurons burning hot from the induced sensations she realised that she was cowering down and screaming without making a sound.
      She was in fact pushing a saturated stream of information into the void but couldn't register it herself.<br>
      Mind numbed by the sudden barrage of input she stood up and began to move through the neon expanse.
      This stuff must have left some traces and probably sparked all kinds of interest she wasn't keen on sharing with whatever that was.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fuck..."<br>
      She needed to move, fast!
