    She realized that her heart was pounding. It was the adrena-
    lin messing with her mind. Her lizard brain telling her to
    run. But where do you run when space no longer holds any
    meaning?
    This whole thing was simply too big for her taste. Doing
    Sosu had felt like a challenge but going strait to the c0re
    and messing with an AI was just plain crazy.
    But the c0re had already messed with her. She wasn\'t just
    following the footsteps of a c0re-dev gone rogue, she had
    been lead here.
    But by whom? Chaos? Curiosity? Did it even matter?

    She gathered her thoughts. Someone had hired her to get
    something out of Sosu Neotech but that had only been a
    cover-story to get her in and make contact. That much was
    obvious.
    Contact with Falken? Or with the c0re?
    She felt the overwhelming sensation of all people in
    history who knew that they were part of something bigger.
    And as things went ever so often this had become something
    she could no longer control. Realizing that fact shifted
    her focus to the actions she could take at this point.
    
    First:  Fuck Sosu, Fuck Chaos, Fuck Falken! Leave and never
            come back. South Africa was supposed to be a nice
            place at this time of the year and it would take
            her around five weeks to get there on one of the
            big cargo floaters.
    
    Second: See this through. Push on and try to live with
            whatever fucked up shit was waiting for her at the 
            end of this job.
    
    Control. The one thing she had valued more then anything
    in her life until she had nothing else left.
    And now she was about to let go...

                         "I say unto you:
               one must still have chaos in oneself
            to be able to give birth to a dancing star.
                          I say unto you: 
                you still have chaos in yourselves."

                - Nietzsche, Thus spoke Zarathustra

    It shook her like a kick in the stomach. The sudden feeling 
    of physicality that did not belong in here and broke her
    reference frame.
    It was cold... just a slight shiver, her body\'s reaction to
    an external stimulus. She had taken great precautions to
    avoid such distractions. This was not arbitrary, someone was
    in her room and messing with her body.
    She knew that she had only a limited amount of time.
    The trace had just been a tactic to delay the inevitable. She
    must have left a quite interesting profile, hopping from
    cluster to cluster, accessing all those logs and being focused
    by direct c0re data-streams.

    This was a courtesy call, a nod from h4ck3r to h4ck3r.
    Letting her know that she was about to be plugged.
